## Pivoting
Utilizing multiple hosts to cross network boundaries you would not usually have access to. This is more of a targeted objective. The goal here is to allow us to move deeper into a network by compromising targeted hosts or infrastructure.

## Tunneling
Tunneling is a technique used to encapsulate and transfer one type of network traffic through another network protocol or connection. It allows you to create a virtual "tunnel" within a network, enabling communication between two endpoints while appearing as regular traffic of the encapsulating protocol.
