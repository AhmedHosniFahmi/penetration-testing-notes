dns concepts
------------

*Resource Record          : -A domain name, usually a fully qualified domain name, is the first part of a Resource Record.
                           -If you don't use a fully qualified domain name, the zone's name where the record is located will be appended to the end of the name.
                              EX : zone   = example.com
                                   domain = www.example.com
                                   if you use www the example.com will be appended automaticly




*TTL                      : In seconds, the Time-To-Live (TTL) defaults to the minimum value specified in the SOA record.


*Record Class             : Internet, Hesiod, or Chaos

    IN (Internet):
        The IN class is the most widely used and the default class for DNS resource records.
        It is used for standard DNS operations on the Internet.
        Most DNS resource records, such as A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, and TXT, are created within the IN class.
        Example: example.com. IN A 192.0.2.123

    HS (Hesiod):
        The HS class is less commonly used and is primarily associated with the Hesiod naming system.
        Hesiod is an older naming service that provides a distributed database for storing information like user names, passwords, and other system-related data.
        It is often used in Unix-like systems for additional naming and directory service lookups.
        Example: user1.hs. HS TXT "User1's information"

    CH (Chaos):
        The CH class is also less commonly used and is associated with the Chaosnet networking protocol.
        Chaosnet was an early networking protocol developed at MIT in the 1970s.
        The CH class is used for querying special information related to the network and system status, debugging, and testing purposes.
        Example: version.bind. CH TXT "BIND version 9.11.3"


*namespace               : refers to the hierarchical structure that organizes and identifies domain names



*Domain Name             : -A domain name is a human-readable label or identifier used to access resources on the internet.
                           -It represents a specific entity or organization and typically consists of two or more labels separated by dots. For example, "example.com" is a domain name.
                           -Domain names are registered with domain registrars and provide a unique identity for websites, email servers, and other internet services.

*DNS Zone                : -A DNS zone is a portion of the DNS namespace that is managed by a specific set of DNS servers.
                           -It encompasses all the DNS resource records associated with a particular domain or subdomain.
                           -A DNS zone is defined by a zone file, which contains the DNS records for the domain or subdomain.
                           -The zone file specifies the authoritative name servers for the zone and includes records like A, CNAME, MX, TXT, etc. Each domain or subdomain has its own DNS zone with its own set of DNS records.



*DNS server === Name Server


Resource Records
----------------
*TTL            : -The TTL value specifies the amount of time (in seconds) that a DNS resolver or client should cache the DNS records obtained from the DNS server before checking for updated records.
                 -It indicates how long the DNS information can be considered valid and cached by other systems.


*Name Servers (NS)        : The distributed database is bound together by NS Records. They are in charge of a zone's authoritative name server and the authority for a child zone to a name server.

*IPv4 Addresses (A)       : The A record is only a mapping between a hostname and an IP address. 'Forward' zones are those with A records.

*Pointer (PTR)            : The PTR record is a mapping between an IP address and a hostname. 'Reverse' zones are those that have PTR records.

*Canonical Name (CNAME)   : An alias hostname is mapped to an A record hostname using the CNAME record.

*Mail Exchange (MX) 	  : -The MX record identifies a host that will accept emails for a specific host.
                            -A priority value has been assigned to the specified host.
                            -Multiple MX records can exist on the same host, and a prioritized list is made consisting of the records for a specific host.

*TEXT(TXT)                : record provides arbitrary text information for the domain.


*Start Of Authority (SOA) : -It should be first in a zone file because it indicates the start of a zone.
                            -Each zone can only have one SOA record, and additionally, it contains the zone's values, such as a serial number and multiple expiration timeouts.

     EX :
     subdomain.example.com
     $TTL 3600
     @   IN  SOA   ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
                 2023062201  ; Serial number
                 3600        ; Refresh
                 1800        ; Retry
                 604800      ; Expire
                 86400       ; Minimum TTL
                 )
SOA recoreds
------------

Primary Name Server (NS): -This field specifies the primary authoritative name server for the zone.
                          -It indicates the DNS server responsible for serving the zone's DNS records and managing updates to the zone. For example: ns1.example.com.

Responsible Person's Email Address (Email): -This field specifies the email address of the responsible person or administrator overseeing the zone.
                                            -It is typically written with a dot replaced by an "@" symbol. For example: admin.example.com.

Serial Number  : -The serial number is a unique identifier for the zone's DNS records.
                 -It is typically a numeric value and is incremented each time the zone's records are updated.
                 -In the given example, the serial number is "2023062201", which suggests that it was last updated or modified on June 22, 2023. The serial number helps in determining the freshness of DNS     data during zone transfers between DNS servers.

Refresh        : -The refresh value indicates how often (in seconds) secondary DNS servers should check the authoritative DNS server for updates.
                 -In the provided configuration, the refresh value is set to 3600 seconds (1 hour).
                 -Secondary DNS servers will contact the authoritative server to update their copies of the zone's records at least once every hour.

Retry          : -The retry value specifies the amount of time (in seconds) that secondary DNS servers should wait before retrying a failed zone transfer or refresh attempt.
                 -If a secondary DNS server fails to contact the authoritative server during the refresh interval, it will wait for the retry interval before attempting again.
                 -In the given example, the retry value is set to 1800 seconds (30 minutes).

Expire         : -The expire value sets the maximum time (in seconds) that secondary DNS servers can use a zone's data without successfully refreshing it from the authoritative server.
                 -If a secondary server fails to refresh the zone within the specified expire interval, it will consider the zone expired and stop responding to DNS queries for that zone.
                 -In the provided configuration, the expire value is set to 604800 seconds (7 days).



Minimum TTL   : -The Minimum TTL (also known as the Negative TTL or Default TTL) is a value that specifies how long a negative DNS response (indicating the non-existence of a a DNS record) should be cached
                by dns resolver or a client.
                -It is used when a query is made for a resource record that does not exist.






dns zone
----------


-The $ORIGIN directive sets the origin for the zone to "example.com." This means that any domain names specified without a trailing dot (.) will be considered relative to "example.com."

-"@" symbol represents the origin or the current zone name.

Directives: Lines starting with a dollar sign ($) or at symbol (@) are directives that provide instructions or settings for the zone. Examples include $ORIGIN, which sets the origin for the zone, and $TTL, which sets the default time-to-live value for the zone.

Records: Records specify the DNS resource records for the domain. In the example, you have various record types, such as SOA, NS, MX, TXT, and A. Each record has a specific purpose and provides different types of information.
