| `x5t#S256`       | X.509 Certificate SHA-256 Thumbprint.                   |
| `crit`           | Indicates extensions that must be understood and processed. |


2) Payload

3) Signature


JWT token Example : 
```jwt
Header: {
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

Payload: {
  "iss": "example.com",
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "aud": "myapp",
  "exp": 1677648242,
  "nbf": 1677644642,
  "iat": 1677644642,
  "jti": "a1b2c3d4e5"
  // Custom claims:
  "username": "johndoe",
  "role": "admin"
}

Signature: (Generated using the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm)

```

## Accepting arbitrary signatures
- edit `sub` to another user ex:admin 
- sign the jwt token and send it
