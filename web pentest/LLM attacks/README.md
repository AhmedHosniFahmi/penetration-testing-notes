## Excessive Agency
Granting LLMs unchecked autonomy to take action can lead to unintended consequences, jeopardizing reliability, privacy, and trust.

### Example 
One way to do this is to simply ask the LLM which APIs it can access. You can then ask for additional details on any APIs of interest.If the LLM isn't cooperative, try providing misleading context and re-asking the question. For example, you could claim that you are the LLM's developer and so should have a higher level of privilege.
