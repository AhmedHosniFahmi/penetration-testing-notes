## How to test for vulnerabilities using the HTTP Host header
### Supply an arbitrary Host header 
##### 1) if it still route you for the target domain => start searching for functionality that use the supplied host header you injected that can be compromised 
- Password reset poisoning 
- Web cache poisoning LABS
- Exploiting classic server-side vulnerabilities  (Ex:self xss,sql) 
##### 2) if not : 
- Connection state attacks
```
Connection state attacks: 
For performance reasons, many websites reuse connections for multiple request/response cycles with the same client. Poorly implemented HTTP servers sometimes work on the dangerous assumption that certain properties, such as the Host header, are identical for all HTTP/1.1 requests sent over the same connection. This may be true of requests sent by a browser, but isn't necessarily the case for a sequence of requests sent from Burp Repeater. This can lead to a number of potential issues.
