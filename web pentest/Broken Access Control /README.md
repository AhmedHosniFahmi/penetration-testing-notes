# Methodology

## Mass Assignment
- ex : inject paramter isAdmin=true

## HTTP Verb Tampering
- try different verbs on every function to execute forbidden functions or bypass protection filters

| HTTP Method | Description                                                                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET         | The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data. |
| HEAD        | The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body.         |
| POST        | The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server. |
| PUT         | The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.   |
| DELETE      | The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.                                                       |
| CONNECT     | The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.                |
| OPTIONS     | The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.                         |
| TRACE       | The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.               |
| PATCH       | The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource.                                           |


## IDOR
- check [IDOR](https://github.com/kiro6/penetration-testing-notes/tree/main/web%20pentest/Idor)

## Referer-based access control
- ex : if you want to access /admin/deleteusers but it is forbbiden , try put `Referer: /admin/`

## IP-based access control
