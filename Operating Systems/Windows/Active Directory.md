## Group Policy Objects 
Group Policy Objects (GPOs) can be linked to OUs to apply specific configurations, settings, and policies to the objects within those OUs. This allows administrators to apply different policies based on the requirements of different departments or organizational units.


## Objects 

### Groups
there are 2 types of groups 
1) **security Group:**
used to manage access permissions to resources such as files, folders, printers, and other objects within the network. Security groups allow you to grant or deny access to these resources based on the membership of users or other groups.

2) **Distribution Groups:**
These are used primarily for email distribution purposes. Distribution groups allow you to send emails to multiple recipients by simply addressing the email to the group rather than individual email addresses.
